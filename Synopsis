Time series analysis using machine learning refers to the application of machine learning algorithms to time series data 
to make predictions or uncover patterns and relationships. Time series data is a sequence of data points collected over time, 
such as stock prices, weather patterns, or sales data. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to model these time series data 
and make predictions about future values based on past observations. 

In our dataset, time is recorded between January 1992 and December 2020 for the value and value of manufacturer shipments. 
First, we have resampled our time series data. That resamples the data in a Pandas DataFrame dataset using the resample method. 
The rule argument is set to 'AS', which stands for "annual start frequency". 
The method returns the mean of the values in each resampled group, and the resulting data is shown for the first 5 rows using the head method. 
This code essentially aggregates the data in the dataset DataFrame to an annual frequency and calculates the mean value for each year.

We then use the rolling mean method in our dataset. That computes a rolling mean for the data in a Pandas DataFrame dataset. 
The rolling method is used to specify a rolling window size of 10(in our case), which means that for each data point, the mean of the values in the previous 10 
data points will be calculated. The resulting data is shown for the first 20 rows using the head method. 
The rolling mean is a common method to smooth out short-term fluctuations in time series data and highlight long-term trends.

After time resampling and rolling mean, we plotted our time data in the graphs which are shown in our code.

The future scope and usability of time series analysis is broad and promising, as it is widely used in various fields and industries. 
Some of the key areas where time series analysis is expected to have significant impact and growth include:

   1.Forecasting
   2.Predictive maintenance
   3.Healthcare
   4.Energy and environment
   5.Customer behavior

Overall, time series analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to gain insights into data and make predictions about future trends and patterns. 
Its impact and usefulness are expected to continue to grow in the future, and it will likely play a crucial role in driving innovation 
and growth in many industries and fields.
