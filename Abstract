Time series analysis using machine learning refers to the application of machine learning algorithms to time series data 
to make predictions or uncover patterns and relationships. Time series data is a sequence of data points collected over time, 
such as stock prices, weather patterns, or sales data. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to model these time series data 
and make predictions about future values based on past observations. 

In our dataset, time is recorded between January 1992 and December 2020 for the value and value of manufacturer shipments.

First, we have resampled our time series data.
Time resampling is a pre-processing step in time series analysis that involves changing the frequency of the data points in a time series.

We then used the rolling mean method in our dataset.
Rolling mean, also known as moving average, is a commonly used pre-processing step in machine learning that is applied to smooth time series data. 
The rolling mean is calculated by taking the average of a fixed number of consecutive data points in the time series. In our case, it was from 1992 to 2020.
The result is a smoothed version of the original time series data, which can be used as input for machine learning models. 
The number of data points used to calculate the rolling mean is known as the window size. We have taken 10 as the size of the window.
A larger window size results in a smoother time series, while a smaller window size retains more of the original fluctuations in the data. 
Rolling mean can be applied to remove noise from time series data and to make patterns and trends in the data more visible.

After time resampling and rolling mean, we plotted our time data in the graphs which are shown in our code.

The future scope and usability of time series analysis is broad and promising, as it is widely used in various fields and industries. 
Some of the key areas where time series analysis is expected to have significant impact and growth include:

   1.Forecasting
   2.Predictive maintenance
   3.Healthcare
   4.Energy and environment
   5.Customer behavior

Overall, time series analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to gain insights into data and make predictions about future trends and patterns. 
Its impact and usefulness are expected to continue to grow in the future, and it will likely play a crucial role in driving innovation 
and growth in many industries and fields.
