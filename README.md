## The majority of industries and organizations commonly use time series data, which means any information collected over a regular interval of time, in their operations. Examples include daily stock prices, energy consumption rates, social media engagement metrics, and retail demand, among others. AnalyzingÂ time series data yields insights like trends, seasonal patterns, and forecasts of future events that can help generate profits.For example, by understanding seasonal trends in demand for retail products, companies can plan promotions to maximize sales throughout the year.

## 1. **What is a time series?**

 * A time series is a set of observations taken at specified times usually at equal intervals.
 * It is used to predict future values based on previously observed values.

## 2. The importance of time series:

  * Business forecasting
  * Understand past behavior
  * Plan for the future.
  * Evaluate current accomplishment

## 3. Components of a time series

  * Trend
  * Seasonality
  * Irregularity
  * Cyclic

## 4. When not to use Time Series?

  * Values are constant
  * Values in the form of functions

## 5. What is stationarity?

  * When a series follows a particular pattern over time, there is a very high probability that it will follow the same in the future.

## 6. How to remove stationarity?

  * Constant mean
  * Constant variance
  * Autocovariance that does not depend on time

## 7. Tests to check stationarity

  * Rolling statistics
  * ADCF test

## 8. ARIMA model

  * AR = Auto Regression
  * I = Integration
  * MA = Moving Average
